In order to run the project, follow the below steps.

1) The foremost thing is to install python and Django
    python 3.7
    Django 2.2

2) Create a virtual environment using conda command(if you have it in your system.)

        conda create --name django

        other commands: 
            pip install virtualenv
            python -m virtualenv name

        (Here name is whatever you want to give the name of your virtual environment)

    To activate the environment, 

        conda activate name

3) Get into the directory where the Project is located, 

    Run the following commands before running the server

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py makemigrations 

    if there are any errors regarding modules,

    install it using the pip command 

    for example, 
        pip install ModuleName

4) As soon as the server is running, copy the address and check the web app is running locally.



Project Details & Functionality:

    - This project has two users, Landlord and Tenant.
    - There is a home page, a Sign up page where both of the users can register to Surecave.
    - The users are separated by a radio button on the sign up page. 
    - The login page will redirect them to specific home page according to the type of user.
    - The authentication is done using allauth.
    - The landlord will have the notify page, where he/she can choose the tenant, to which they want to send the notification. 
    - The notification is done using the django-notification module. where few lines of code can help notify one user to the other.
    - On the other hand, the Tenant, will have a page to see the notifications from the landlord.
    - The Tenant will have a payment page, where I have used Stripe API. here the tenant will pay the amount and will be redirected to a confirmation page.
    - After giving the publishable API key to the Stripe, it will give a token and using that token, we can pay the amount. 
    - For testing purpose, while clicking on the payment tab, use the credit card number "4242 4242 4242 4242", and any expiration date as well as any CVV number.
    - I have used bootstrap for better navigation bars.
    - So, overall, the project will have a landlord who can send notifications and the tenant who will get notified and can pay.
